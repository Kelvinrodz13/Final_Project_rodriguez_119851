Description:

Here we have a text-based and graphical recreation of the well-known classic Board Game Parcheesi, also known as Ludo. It originated in medieval India and has been described as the national game of India. Four opposing players attempt to move their pieces or pawns across a cross shaped track. A player will traverse the track based of die rolls. Each player selects four pieces of the same color and places them in their "nest", or starting area. Start the game by entering the pawns in the colores area to the left of the nest and continue counter-clockwise around the board.
Each player rolls a die and the highest roller will go first, and subsequent play continues to the left. The first player to place all of their pawns in the middle of the board wins. 
In our game you will be given the option to roll two die and will be at random. Afterwards, you will be given three options. A: Select a new pawn, B: Move a Pawn or C: End your turn. 

This game was implemented using Python. 

This repository contains two version of the code. The main branch is a version of Parcheesi text based, while the other branches
are the graphical version of the Parcheesi.

The Functioning BRANCH of the graphical version of the code is : PARCHEESI_DEVELOPMENT

Created for an Advanced Programming Class.
